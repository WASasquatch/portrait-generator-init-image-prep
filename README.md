Process portrait images to be more compatible with the Portrait Generator in [Disco Diffusion](https://discodiffusion.com/) or [DD Portrait Playground](https://rebrand.ly/portrait-playground) for creating unique portraits.

## Why prep portrait `init_images`?

Prepping portrait images allows DD to start with an initial init that is easier to imrpovise on. When using a raw portrait of a person, DD has a hard time keeping the cohesion of the original image through diffusion.
